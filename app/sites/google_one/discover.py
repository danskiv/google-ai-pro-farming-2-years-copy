"""Discover where an account actually is, then decide.

Neither the database step nor the settings page tells the truth reliably: the step
column drifts, and Google never shows an end date until a subscription is already
cancelled. What *is* reliable is the projected term in a live offers dialog — open
one with a known layer armed and read the date back.

    no dates at all            -> untouched, start at layer 1
    term ≈ today + 12 months   -> start at layer 2
    term ≈ today + 18 months   -> start at layer 3
    term ≈ today + 24 months   -> nothing to stack, go straight to cancel
